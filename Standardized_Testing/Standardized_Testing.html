                <p>
                        There are three types of standardized tests that students take when applying to college: the ACT, the SAT, and the SAT Subject Tests. The ACT and SAT test students' ability to understand and present ideas and information. The SAT Subject Tests, on the other hand, deal with specific knowledge on certain topics such as biology or history. While schools are required to accept both SAT and ACT tests in admission, schools will often require taking specified SAT Subject Tests for different courses. It is important to know what and where your child wants to study to ensure that all required tests are taken.
